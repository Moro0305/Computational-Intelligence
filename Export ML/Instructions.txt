For executing this activity it's needed to install requirements.txt file, you can do it by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

After installing the requirements, open the Export_ML.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells to execute the activity.
You can find the exported model in the same directory as the notebook, with the name "model.pkl".
This file contains the trained machine learning model that can be used for making predictions on new data.

Then you need to go to the Inference.py file and execute it to see how the exported model can be used for making predictions.
Make sure to have the "model.pkl" file in the same directory as the Inference.py file for it to work properly.
The Inference.py file will load the model and use it to make predictions on a sample input data, which you can modify as needed to test with different inputs.

(If you pull the repository there's no need to change the model location, as it's already configured to be searched in common directories.)

The inference gets help from a UI created with tkinter, which allows you to input the features of the data and get the prediction from the model.
Make sure to have the necessary libraries installed for the UI to work properly, such as tkinter and any other dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
You can run the Inference.py file, and a window will pop up where you can enter the features of the data.
